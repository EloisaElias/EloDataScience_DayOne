#### I love Data Science!


I'm a Data Scientist, and I’m passionate about using data science, programming, and statistical analysis to solve Big Data challenges and deliver valuable business insights.

I've created this repository as my personal reference and for my amusement, practice and better comprehension.

I would love to join a company with big data science projects and challenges. GitHub portfolio for the data science projects I'm working on:
