# EloDataScience_DayOne

Iâ€™m an active member of the Seattle Tech community. I'm a co-organizer of PyLadies Seattle, supporting over 1155 local members. PyLadies is a worldwide group of women developers in Python programming language with presence in Seattle-Bellevue. In addition, I also co-organize the PyData Seattle conferences, which brings together users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other.
